// ABOUTME: Integration tests for ProofMode camera recording workflows
// ABOUTME: Tests end-to-end ProofMode functionality with camera service integration
//
// NOTE: These tests are currently skipped because the underlying ProofMode services
// have not been implemented yet. The services referenced here are:
// - ProofModeCameraIntegration
// - ProofModeKeyService
// - ProofModeAttestationService
// - ProofModeSessionService
// - ProofModeHumanDetection
//
// These are documented in docs/PROOFMODE_ARCHITECTURE.md but do not exist in the
// codebase yet. This file serves as a specification for future implementation.
//
// When the services are implemented, this test file should be updated to:
// 1. Import the actual service implementations
// 2. Create proper test doubles/mocks for the services
// 3. Remove the skip annotations from the test groups
//
// Test coverage planned:
// - Full Recording Workflow: Complete vine recording with ProofMode enabled/disabled
// - Segmented Recording: Pause/resume functionality with proof continuity
// - Error Handling: Graceful recovery from camera and ProofMode service errors
// - Proof Level Determination: verified_mobile, verified_web, basic_proof assignment
// - Human Activity Integration: Natural interaction capture and bot detection
// - Performance: Rapid start/stop cycles and resource cleanup
