            Android's KeyStore system protects keys by keeping them
            inside the device's secure hardware (TEE/StrongBox). Because
            these keys never leave the original device, they are not part
            of a Google Cloud backup. If we allowed the FlutterSecureStorage
            folder to be backed up and then restored onto a new phone, the
            app would possess the "locked" data but not the "key" to open
            it. We exclude this path to prevent decryption errors and ensure
            a stable user experience after a device restore.
