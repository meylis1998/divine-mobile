# Content Moderation Policy

## Overview

Divine is committed to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all users. This document outlines our content moderation processes and compliance with Apple App Store requirements for user-generated content applications.

## Apple App Store Compliance

Divine fully complies with Apple's requirements for user-generated content apps (App Store Review Guideline 1.2):

### ✅ Method for Filtering Objectionable Content

**Implementation:**
- Client-side content filtering via `ContentModerationService`
- User-managed blocklist via `ContentBlocklistService`
- NIP-51 mute list support for decentralized filtering
- Multiple filter categories: spam, harassment, violence, sexual content, copyright violations, misinformation, CSAM, and AI-generated content

**Location:**
- `lib/services/content_moderation_service.dart`
- `lib/services/content_blocklist_service.dart`

### ✅ Mechanism to Report Offensive Content

**Implementation:**
- NIP-56 compliant reporting system (kind 1984 events)
- Report dialog accessible from video menu
- Reports published to `wss://relay.divine.video` (Divine moderation relay)
- 9 distinct report categories

**Location:**
- `lib/services/content_reporting_service.dart`
- `lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart` (ReportContentDialog)

### ✅ Ability to Block Abusive Users

**Implementation:**
- Block/Unblock functionality in video menu
- Blocked users filtered from all feeds (home, explore, hashtag)
- Users can still explicitly visit blocked profiles (maintaining Nostr decentralization principles)

**Location:**
- `lib/services/content_blocklist_service.dart`
- `lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart` (Block User action)

### ✅ Timely Response to Reports (24-Hour SLA)

**Implementation:**
Divine monitors all content reports published to `wss://relay.divine.video` and commits to the following response times:

**Response Time Commitment:**

## Content Categories

Divine recognizes the following violation categories:

1. **Spam or Unwanted Content** - Repetitive, commercial, or off-topic content
2. **Harassment, Bullying, or Threats** - Targeted abuse, intimidation, or threatening behavior
3. **Violent or Extremist Content** - Graphic violence, terrorism, or hate speech

8. **Suspected AI-Generated Content** - Content that may violate authenticity requirements
9. **Other Violation** - Any other community guideline violations

## Severity Levels

Divine uses a four-tier severity system:

- **Info** - Informational only, no action required
- **Warning** - Show warning but allow viewing
- **Hide** - Hide by default, show if user requests
- **Block** - Completely block content, remove from all feeds

## Decentralization Principles

While Divine maintains strict content moderation policies, we respect the decentralized nature of the Nostr protocol:

- **Client-Side Filtering:** Users maintain control over their own blocklists and mute lists via NIP-51
- **Relay Independence:** Users can connect to other relays for uncensored access
- **Profile Visibility:** Blocked users' profiles remain accessible if explicitly visited
- **Data Sovereignty:** User reports and moderation actions are published as Nostr events

## Moderation Team

**Responsible Party:** Divine moderation team
**Contact:** contact@divine.video
**Response Time:** 24 hours for content reports, 48 hours for appeals

## Legal Compliance

Divine complies with:
- Apple App Store Review Guidelines (1.2 User-Generated Content)
- U.S. federal law (COPPA, DMCA, etc.)
- International content moderation standards

**CSAM Policy:** Any reports of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) are immediately escalated to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement as required by law.

## Updates to This Policy

This policy may be updated periodically. Users will be notified of material changes via in-app notifications.
