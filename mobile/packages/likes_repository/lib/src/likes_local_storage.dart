/// locally without being coupled to a specific storage implementation.

/// - `DbLikesLocalStorage` uses db_client's PersonalReactionsDao
/// - In-memory implementations for testing

  /// If a record with the same [LikeRecord.targetEventId] already exists,
  /// it will be replaced.

  ///
  /// More efficient than calling [saveLikeRecord] repeatedly.

  ///
  /// This is a convenience method that returns just the reaction event ID,
  /// which is needed for creating deletion events when unliking.
