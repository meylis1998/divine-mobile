## Project Notes

**PR 683 (fix/444) Review - Video Thumbnails Overflow**

Reviewed the PR changes:
1. `composable_video_grid.dart` - Uses `thumbnailAspectRatio` directly for grid `childAspectRatio`
2. Extracted `_VideoItem` widget wraps thumbnail in `AspectRatio` widget
3. Uses `Stack` with `Align` for proper positioning of info section

The code changes look correct for fixing thumbnail overflow.

**Test Failures - Pre-existing Infrastructure Issue**
The tests fail because `ComposableVideoGrid` uses `UserName` widget which triggers:
- `userProfileReactive` provider → `userProfileService` → `nostrService` → WebSocket connections

This causes `UnsupportedError: Mocked response` and timer pending errors in tests.

The test file at `test/widgets/composable_video_grid_test.dart` needs to use `testProviderScope()` from `test/helpers/test_provider_overrides.dart` instead of manually creating partial provider overrides.

This is NOT caused by PR 683 - it's a pre-existing test infrastructure issue that would fail on main too.
