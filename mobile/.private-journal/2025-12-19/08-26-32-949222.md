## Clip Flow Navigation Fixes (Dec 19, 2025)

Fixed critical navigation issues in the clip editing flow:

### Problem
User reported: "there isn't a clear way to get OUT" and pressing back repeatedly caused crash: "You have popped the last page off of the stack, there are no pages left to show"

### Root Cause
- ClipManagerScreen and VideoEditorScreen used `Navigator.of(context).pop()` 
- This doesn't work properly with go_router navigation
- go_router manages its own navigation stack

### Solution
1. **ClipManagerScreen**: Changed `Navigator.pop()` to `context.go('/camera')`
2. **VideoEditorScreen**: Changed `Navigator.pop()` to `context.go('/clip-manager')`
3. Added confirmation dialogs before discarding edits
4. Changed back arrows to X (close) icons for clarity

### Files Modified
- `lib/screens/clip_manager_screen.dart` - X button, confirmation dialog, improved duration warning
- `lib/screens/video_editor_screen.dart` - X button, confirmation dialog, added go_router and VineTheme imports

### Duration Warning Improvement
Changed from vague "Over 6.3 seconds limit" to specific: "Over limit! Last X.Xs will be cut when you publish."

### Key Insight
When using go_router, always use `context.go()` or `context.pop()` instead of `Navigator.of(context).pop()`. The Navigator methods bypass go_router's stack management.
