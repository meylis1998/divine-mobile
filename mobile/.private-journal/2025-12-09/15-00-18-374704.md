## Project Notes

Blossom upload integration test now working with REAL Nostr keys:

Key discovery: The nostr_sdk Event class API is:
- Constructor: `Event(pubkey, kind, tags, content, {createdAt})`
- Signing: `event.sign(privateKey)` - modifies in place, returns void
- Key generation: `generatePrivateKey()` and `getPublicKey(privateKey)` from `nostr_sdk/client_utils/keys.dart`

Test file: `test/integration/blossom_real_upload_test.dart`
- Generates throwaway keypair
- Creates kind 24242 auth event with proper tags (t=upload, expiration, x=hash, size)
- Signs with Schnorr signature
- Streams file to server
- Server `separately-robust-roughy.edgecompute.app` accepts uploads and returns 200

The first run got 500 (server issue), second run got 200 success. Server may have been warming up or had a transient issue.
