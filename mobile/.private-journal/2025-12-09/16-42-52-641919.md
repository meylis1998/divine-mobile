## Project Notes

Continuing debugging Blossom 404 issue. Key insight from summary: For large files (>500KB), Cloud Run computes its own SHA256. The server returns URL based on server's hash. Need to verify if client hash differs from server hash, causing URL mismatch. Next step: trace how videoId/hash flows from upload response to playback URL.
