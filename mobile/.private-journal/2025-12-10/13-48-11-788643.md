## Project Notes

Continuing session on relay settings enhancement. User wants more detailed stats in the relay settings screen:
- Active subscriptions
- Requests this session
- Events processed
- Connection status
- Last connected time if timeout
- Failed requests
- Tap to expand for full stats

Already explored:
- relay_settings_screen.dart - current simple UI
- nostr_service_interface.dart - available interface methods
- nostr_service.dart - getRelayStats() returns db stats, subscription stats, p2p info

Need to find:
1. What per-relay stats are available
2. The embedded relay implementation for more granular stats
3. How to track per-relay connection history and errors
