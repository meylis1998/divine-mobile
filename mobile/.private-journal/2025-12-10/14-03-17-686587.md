## Project Notes

RelayStatisticsService exists with all the right methods (recordConnection, recordEventReceived, etc.) but NostrService doesn't call any of them. Need to wire this up. NostrService already has relayStatuses getter that queries embedded relay for connection info - could use that as a starting point but need actual event callbacks.
