## Project Notes

VineDrawer branding fix:
- Updated drawer header to use diVine wordmark (assets/icon/White on black.png) instead of generic icon
- Removed "OpenVine" text branding
- Wordmark height set to 50px with proper alignment
- Following TDD: test written, implementation updated, waiting for build_runner to complete to verify tests pass

Pre-existing compilation error found: nostr_events_dao.dart missing videoMetrics accessor. Running build_runner clean + rebuild to regenerate Drift code.
