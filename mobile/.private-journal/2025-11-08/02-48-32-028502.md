## Project Notes

Report content dialog changes:
- Submit button now always visible (Apple requirement) - shows error snackbar if no reason selected
- Added "Block this user" checkbox that calls ContentBlocklistService.blockUser() on successful report
- Widget tests verify checkbox state management
- Full submit+block flow requires integration test due to complex navigation (2x Navigator.pop)

Files modified:
- lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart - ReportContentDialog implementation
- test/widgets/report_content_dialog_test.dart - TDD widget tests

Pattern learned: For dialogs with complex navigation (multiple pops), separate widget state tests from navigation flow tests.
