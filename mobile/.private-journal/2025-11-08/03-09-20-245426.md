## Project Notes

Report content dialog implementation complete:
- Submit button always visible (Apple requirement) ✅
- Block user checkbox with proper Nostr event publishing ✅
- When blocking: publishes kind 1984 for USER, kind 10000 mute list, and adds to local blocklist
- When not blocking: only publishes kind 1984 for CONTENT
- All 4 tests passing ✅
- Flutter analyze clean for modified files ✅
