## Project Notes

**Mutual Mute List Feature - Background Sync**

Feature request from Rabble for OpenVine:

**Goal**: Implement mutual content filtering based on mute lists - if someone has muted our user, hide their content from our user's feeds.

**Implementation approach**:
1. **Background sync (low priority, non-blocking)**:
   - On app startup (after critical loads), subscribe to:
     - Kind 30000-30004 (user's NIP-51 lists - bookmarks, pins, etc.)
     - Kind 10000 events WHERE our user's pubkey is tagged (other people's mute lists)
   - Store in SQLite via embedded relay
   - Keep updated as new events arrive

2. **Content filtering**:
   - Apply to ALL feeds (home, discovery, search, hashtag, profile)
   - Apply to replies/comments too
   - Silent filtering - just don't show content from people who muted us

3. **Blocked user UI**:
   - When navigating directly to profile/video of someone who muted us
   - Show message like "This account is not available" or similar (check Instagram/TikTok copy)

**Architecture notes**:
- Use existing embedded relay SQLite storage
- Add filter logic to VideoEventService and comment rendering
- Low priority background process - don't block startup
- Persist mute list data between sessions

**Status**: Documented, not yet implemented
