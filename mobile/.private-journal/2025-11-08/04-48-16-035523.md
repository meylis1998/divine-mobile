## Project Notes

**Profile Update Flow Now Working**

Fixed profile save hanging by removing broken verification:
- Removed `fetchProfile(forceRefresh: true)` call that hung on subscription reuse
- Now directly updates cache after successful broadcast
- Profile updates appear instantly in UI

**Subscription Manager Issue Identified**:
- Reusing subscriptions with identical filters breaks `forceRefresh`
- Should either: close old subscription first OR check if subscription is "completed" (EOSE received)
- Left unfixed for now - workaround is to not rely on force refresh when you already have the data

**UI Changes Made**:
- Hidden NIP-05 username field (waiting for @divine.video)
- Added back arrow to profile edit screen
- Changed buttons to "Save" / "Cancel"
- Removed "Skip" and Nostr explanation sections
