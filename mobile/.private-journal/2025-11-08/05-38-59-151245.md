## Project Notes

VineDrawer branding fix (corrected):
- Initially chose "White on black.png" wordmark which looked bad on the green gradient
- User feedback: wordmark choice was wrong, should use actual logo
- Fixed by using app_icon.png (60x60px) instead of wordmark
- Added app_icon.png to pubspec.yaml assets list
- All tests pass with logo image
- Much better visual result

Key learning: When updating app branding in headers/drawers, prefer the actual app logo/icon over wordmarks unless specifically designed for that context.
