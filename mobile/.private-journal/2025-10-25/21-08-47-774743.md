## Project Notes

Analytics API integration test failures:
- Tests are trying to hit REAL production API at https://api.openvine.co
- All requests return HTTP 400
- Issue is NOT the TestWidgetsFlutterBinding (changing to package:test/test.dart didn't help)
- The actual API endpoints appear to be down or not implemented
- Tests should either:
  1. Be skipped/disabled until API is working
  2. Use mock HTTP client
  3. Be moved to a separate test suite that only runs when API is confirmed working
  
These tests can't be "fixed" without either implementing the backend API or changing them to use mocks, which would make them unit tests not integration tests.
