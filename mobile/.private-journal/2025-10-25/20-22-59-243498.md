## Project Notes

Completed test failure analysis and fixes. Key finding: Most test failures (56+ tests) are actually tests for unimplemented features (ProofMode stubs, analytics API). The real value was finding a CRITICAL production bug in the feature flag system where ChangeNotifier was removed during refactoring but the reactivity mechanism wasn't properly replaced. This meant feature flag toggles in production weren't updating the UI! Fixed by re-adding ChangeNotifier with proper listener setup. Also fixed 1 outdated test expectation for Blossom URL. Total: 6 tests fixed, 1 critical bug fixed, 2 commits made.
