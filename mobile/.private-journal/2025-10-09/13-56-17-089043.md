## Project Notes

**Phase 2 Status**: Implementation complete, unit tests challenging

Added tab visibility listeners to:
- `lib/screens/video_feed_screen.dart` (tab 0)
- `lib/screens/explore_screen.dart` (tab 2)  
- `lib/screens/profile_screen_scrollable.dart` (tab 3)

Each screen now listens to `tabVisibilityProvider` and clears active video when tab becomes hidden.

Unit tests are difficult due to Riverpod listener lifecycle in tests. Moving forward with Phases 3 & 4, will verify tab behavior in integration/manual testing.
