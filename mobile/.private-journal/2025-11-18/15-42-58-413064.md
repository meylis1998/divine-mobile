## Project Notes

OpenVine embedded relay removal status:
- Branch: test-remove-embedded-relay (tracking derekross/remove-embedded-relay)
- P2P system completely removed (incompatible with new architecture)
- Builds successfully on macOS
- App launches and runs
- Some test failures exist but are unrelated to our changes
- Total changes: 150 files, removed ~5000 lines of P2P/embedded relay code

Next steps if continuing this work:
- Fix unrelated test failures (comments API, proofmode)
- Test relay connections actually work with external relays
- Verify video publishing/subscribing works
- Test on iOS/Android to ensure no platform-specific issues
