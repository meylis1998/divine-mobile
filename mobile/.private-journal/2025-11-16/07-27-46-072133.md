## Project Notes

**ExploreScreen Navigation Issue:**
- Current behavior: Tapping a list in Lists tab uses `Navigator.push()` to go to a completely new screen (CuratedListFeedScreen or UserListPeopleScreen)
- This makes the tabs disappear because you're on a different screen
- Solution needed: Keep tabs visible by showing list content inline, similar to hashtag mode
- Hashtag mode pattern (line 205-216): Sets internal state, updates custom title, stays on same screen
- Need to apply same pattern for list viewing
