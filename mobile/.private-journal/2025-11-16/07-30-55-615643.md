## Project Notes

**ExploreScreen List Navigation Fix - Complete:**

**Problem:** When tapping into a list from the Lists tab, the app used `Navigator.push()` to navigate to a completely separate screen (CuratedListFeedScreen or UserListPeopleScreen), which made the three tabs disappear.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Added inline list viewing mode to ExploreScreen (similar to hashtag mode pattern)
2. Added state fields: `_listMode`, `_listName`, `_isUserList` to track current list
3. Created `_enterListMode()` method to switch to list viewing while keeping tabs visible
4. Updated `_resetToDefaultState()` to clear list mode when switching tabs
5. Created `_buildListModeContent()` to display list content inline
6. Created `_buildCuratedListContent()` for video lists
7. Created `_buildUserListContent()` for people lists (with people carousel)
8. Created `_buildPeopleCarousel()` to show user avatars (tappable to profiles)
9. Updated all list card tap handlers to use `_enterListMode()` instead of `Navigator.push()`
10. Made creator names tappable in video grid tiles to navigate to user profiles

**Key Changes:**
- `lib/screens/explore_screen.dart`: Added list mode support, removed Navigator.push calls
- `lib/widgets/composable_video_grid.dart`: Made creator names tappable with underline decoration

**Result:** Tabs now stay visible when viewing lists, and users can tap creator names to view profiles.
