## macOS GoRouter Navigation Bug (Dec 20, 2025)

**Problem**: `context.push()` hangs on macOS when navigating from ClipManagerScreen to VideoEditorScreen. The redirect function completes and returns null, but the route builder is never called. Navigation observer's didPush is never triggered.

**Key Symptom**: 
- Redirect logs show: "Redirect END for: /edit-video, returning null"
- Then silence - route builder never executes
- Works on iOS, breaks on macOS

**Attempted fixes that DIDN'T work**:
1. Changing from `ref.read(goRouterProvider).push()` to `context.push()` - same hang
2. Adding try-catch around the push call - no exception thrown

**Fix that might work**: Using `context.go()` instead of `context.push()`. 

The December 19 conversation showed that forward navigation in the clip flow consistently used `context.go()`:
- VideoEditor → ClipManager: `context.go('/clip-manager')`
- ClipManager → Camera: `context.go('/camera')`

The difference:
- `push()` adds to navigation stack (modal-style)
- `go()` replaces/navigates (declarative-style)

For linear flows like camera → clips → editor, `go()` is probably more appropriate anyway.
