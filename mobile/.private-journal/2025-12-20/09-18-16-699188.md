## Project Notes

**CamerAwesome iOS crash fix** - December 20, 2025

Root cause: MY OWN COMMIT ae94993c introduced the bug! I added RepaintBoundary and GlobalKey wrapper to the CameraAwesomeBuilder thinking it would help prevent layout errors. Instead, it CAUSED them by conflicting with CamerAwesome's internal GlobalKey handling in PreviewFitWidget.

Rabble was right to point out this bug wasn't there yesterday - it was literally something I introduced today while trying to "fix" something.

Lesson learned:
1. Don't add wrappers with GlobalKey to widgets that have their own internal GlobalKey management
2. When a bug appears "suddenly", check recent commits first
3. Rabble's instinct that this was a code change issue, not a library issue, was correct

Fixed by reverting to the original clean CameraAwesomeBuilder.custom() call without wrappers. Commit 5a8c4cad.
