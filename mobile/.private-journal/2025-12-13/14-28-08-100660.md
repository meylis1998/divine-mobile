SafeJsonCacheInfoRepository correctly uses getApplicationSupportDirectory() - this matches what JsonCacheInfoRepository uses. The earlier reviewer feedback claiming it should use getTemporaryDirectory() was incorrect.

Commit acdebd08 has the correct implementation with updated tests documenting the correct directory.
