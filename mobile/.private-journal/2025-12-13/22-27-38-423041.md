## Project Notes

**Video editing feature navigation fix:**

Added `RouteType.clipManager` and `RouteType.editVideo` to:
- `lib/router/route_utils.dart` - enum + parseRoute + buildRoute  
- `lib/providers/active_video_provider.dart` - exhaustive switch statement
- `test/router/route_utils_test.dart` - added tests for both routes

The ClipManager screen was auto-popping because `/clip-manager` wasn't recognized by parseRoute(), causing route_normalization_provider to redirect to `/home/0`.

Files changed:
- lib/router/route_utils.dart
- lib/providers/active_video_provider.dart  
- test/router/route_utils_test.dart
