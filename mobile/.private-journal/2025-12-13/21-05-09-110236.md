## Project Notes

Completed video editing features design brainstorm with Rabble:

**Three features designed:**
1. Clip Manager - thumbnail grid, tap to preview modal, drag to reorder, delete segments
2. Text Overlay - pro_video_editor image layers (render Flutter text to PNG, overlay)
3. Sound Picker - ~200 bundled classic Vine sounds, scrollable list with search

**Key technical decisions:**
- pro_video_editor for text overlay (native, no FFmpeg font issues)
- FFmpeg still needed for: segment concat, audio mixing
- just_audio for sound preview playback
- Two-screen flow: Clip Manager → Editor

**Rabble's preferences:**
- Simple UX first (thumbnail grid not timeline, list not categories)
- Sound plays during recording as guide, mixed at export
- Full-duration text only for v1, timing later
- ~30-50MB for bundled sounds is acceptable

**Design doc committed to:** feature/video-editing-tools branch
**File:** docs/plans/2025-12-13-video-editing-features-design.md
