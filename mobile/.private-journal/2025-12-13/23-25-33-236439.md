## Project Notes

Session continued from previous context. Verified and cleaned up several fixes:

1. **Segment extraction fix** - Already applied at lines 872-874 in vine_recording_controller.dart. The `_recordingStartTime` is now preserved in `completeRecording()` success path so that `extractSegmentFiles()` can access it. Only cleared in error path (line 885).

2. **Unused field cleanup** - Removed `_videoSize` field from VideoEditorScreen that was set but never read. The code uses `_videoController!.value.size` directly instead.

3. **Deleted orphan test** - Removed `test/examples/example_service_test.dart` which referenced non-existent `ExampleService` class.

4. **Updated test** - Fixed `test/screens/clip_manager_screen_test.dart` to expect "No clips recorded" instead of "No clips" to match the redesigned UI.

All tests passing now. Flutter analyze clean (only 2 info warnings about unnecessary imports in test files).
