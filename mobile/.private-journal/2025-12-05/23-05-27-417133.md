## Project Notes

IMPORTANT FINDING: The feat/new-cache-strategy PR #310 has a regression. Main branch gets new videos from relay, the PR branch does NOT. I was wrong earlier when I assumed it was a pre-existing bug in flutter_embedded_nostr_relay - the A/B test proves the PR broke something. Need to investigate what's different.
