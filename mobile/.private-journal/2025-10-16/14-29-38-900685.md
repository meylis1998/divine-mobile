## Project Notes

**Home Feed Fix Session Summary**

Fixed critical bug where home feed showed "No videos available" despite user following 16 people.

**Files Modified**:
- lib/providers/home_feed_provider.dart (line 133: ref.read → ref.watch)

**Testing**: App now successfully loads 52 videos on startup. First video has playback error (corrupted file), but that's unrelated to our fix.

**Next Issues to Address**:
1. Explore video playback needs testing
2. Multiple rapid rebuilds detected (BUILD #2 at 337ms, BUILD #3 at 22ms) - may need optimization
3. Some videos show "social initialized: false" even after loading - investigate why socialProvider.isInitialized stays false
