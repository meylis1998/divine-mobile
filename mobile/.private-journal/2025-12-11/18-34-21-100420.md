## Project Notes

Continuing PR review session for PR #393 (fix/explore_user_names). Last state: rebased onto main successfully, flutter analyze passed with only pre-existing warnings. Tests couldn't compile due to pre-existing RelayMode.BASE_MODE error in nsec_bunker_client.dart - this is NOT related to PR #393.

User's workflow pattern: checkout → rebase → analyze → test → force push. Since analyze passed and the test compilation error is pre-existing (not caused by this PR), I should inform the user and recommend proceeding with force push.
