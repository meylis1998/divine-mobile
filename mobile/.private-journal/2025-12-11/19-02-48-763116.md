## Project Notes

Continuing session on fix/blossom-streaming-upload branch. Previous work completed the Blossom server URL migration. Now focusing on fixing the profile edit screen navigation bug - black screen of death when user navigates directly to /edit-profile and then saves. The issue is Navigator.pop() crashes when the route is the root route (ModalRoute.isFirst = true, Navigator.canPop = false). Need to check canPop before popping and use context.go() as fallback.
