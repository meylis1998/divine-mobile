## Project Notes

Continuing work on ci/enforce-warnings-info-as-fatal-rebased branch. Need to:
1. Apply CI workflow changes (remove --no-fatal-warnings --no-fatal-infos)
2. Regenerate mocks with build_runner
3. Run flutter analyze and fix issues
4. Commit and push

The original PR #382 had massive rebase conflicts due to mock file changes. Taking the clean approach of applying changes manually on fresh branch from main.
