## Project Notes

Session continuation - fixing flutter analyze errors in test files. The CI failed because blossom_real_upload_test.dart and gen_keys.dart were using the old nostr_sdk API (Keys.generate(), EventBuilder) instead of the correct API (Keychain.generate() from nostr_key_manager, Event from nostr_sdk/event.dart). Already fixed both files, need to remove unused crypto import and commit/push.
