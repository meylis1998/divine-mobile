## Project Notes

**Zendesk Integration Bug Found & Fixed (2025-12-02)**

Root cause: All release build scripts (build_ios.sh, build_android.sh, build_macos.sh, build_native.sh) were NOT passing Zendesk credentials via --dart-define.

Only run_dev.sh had the logic to:
1. Load .env file via `source .env`
2. Build DART_DEFINES string with --dart-define flags
3. Pass $DART_DEFINES to flutter run/build command

This meant:
- Development builds (via run_dev.sh) had Zendesk working
- Release builds had empty credentials → Zendesk never initialized → `isAvailable` was always false

Fix applied: Added the same .env loading + DART_DEFINES logic to:
- build_ios.sh
- build_android.sh  
- build_macos.sh
- build_native.sh

User reported "nothing happens" when tapping Zendesk buttons - this was because the email fallback should have shown instead. Need to verify that the fallback is actually working too.
