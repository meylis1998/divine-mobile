## Project Notes

Task 8 of auto-drafts implementation completed successfully. Created integration test file at mobile/test/integration/auto_draft_complete_flow_test.dart that validates:

1. Complete flow: record → auto-draft → edit → publish (tests draft lifecycle from creation through successful publish and deletion)
2. Failed publish → retry flow (tests error handling, retry button appearance, and attempt count tracking)
3. No duplicate drafts validation (ensures edits update existing draft, not create new ones)

Key implementation details:
- Tests validate data flow without UI rendering (pure integration test)
- Uses DraftStorageService directly to simulate state changes
- Tests PublishStatus enum transitions (draft → publishing → failed/deleted)
- Validates retry logic with publishAttempts counter

Test results: Both tests pass cleanly (00:00 +2: All tests passed!)
No new analyzer issues introduced (flutter analyze shows no issues in the new file)
