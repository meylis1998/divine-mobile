## Project Notes

**Camera initialization fix for external cameras (Sony ZV-E10)**

Root cause: When upgrading video quality, the preset (1080p/720p/high/medium) was set BEFORE adding the video input. This causes `canAddInput()` to fail for external cameras because AVCaptureSession checks compatibility with the current preset.

Fix:
1. Add video input FIRST (no preset constraint)
2. THEN try to set session preset to high quality

Also fixed `getAvailableCameras()` to include `.externalUnknown` device type so external cameras like ZV-E10 show up in the camera list (was only looking for `.builtInWideAngleCamera`).

The original code that worked used `.medium` preset, which is more compatible but lower quality. The new approach adds input first then upgrades to best available quality.
