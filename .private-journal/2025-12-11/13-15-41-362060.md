## Project Notes

## Video Quality Bug Fix - macOS Camera

**Root Cause Found**: NativeCameraPlugin.swift line 145 was using `.medium` session preset, which gives ~480x270 resolution regardless of the camera's capabilities.

**Fix Applied**: Changed preset priority to:
1. `.hd1920x1080` (1080p)
2. `.hd1280x720` (720p)  
3. `.high`
4. `.medium` (fallback only)

Also added logging to show actual capture dimensions after video input is added.

**Key Insight**: AVCaptureSession.Preset.medium is terrible for quality - it's meant for low-bandwidth streaming, not video recording. The ZV-E10 can do 4K but was being forced to 480x270 by this preset.

**File**: `/mobile/macos/NativeCameraPlugin.swift`
