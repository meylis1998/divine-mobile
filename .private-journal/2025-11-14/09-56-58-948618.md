## Project Notes

## Android Loading Screen Hang - ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE (Previous diagnosis was WRONG)

**Real Error from Crashlytics**:
```
Could not find 'libflutter.so'. Looked for: [arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, armeabi], but only found: [].
```

**ACTUAL Root Cause**: Native library packaging issue, NOT ProGuard/R8 stripping Java classes.

The problem is in build.gradle.kts line 65:
```kotlin
packaging {
    jniLibs.pickFirsts.add("**")  // ← THIS IS THE PROBLEM
    resources.pickFirsts.add("**")
}
```

`jniLibs.pickFirsts.add("**")` tells Gradle: "When there are duplicate .so files, pick the first one". But this is causing libflutter.so to be excluded entirely (likely due to conflicts with other native libraries like ProofMode or the embedded Nostr relay).

**Why I was wrong before**:
- I assumed it was hanging during service initialization
- I thought R8 was stripping platform channel classes
- I never asked for the actual crash logs first (violated systematic debugging)

**Lesson learned**: ALWAYS get actual error logs BEFORE forming hypothesis.
