## Project Notes

**Flutter Embedded Nostr Relay - Event Publishing Retry Logic**

Successfully implemented convergent republishing strategy. The system now ensures all locally stored events eventually get published to external relays, even if initial attempts fail.

Key architectural decision: Use published_events table to track successes rather than failures. This creates a convergent system that naturally reaches a stable state (all events published).

The implementation is production-ready with comprehensive tests and proper error handling.
