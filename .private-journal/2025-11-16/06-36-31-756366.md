## Project Notes

**Simulator vs Test Routing Discrepancy - Nov 16**

Rabble reports:
- Tests work fine (black screen bug reproduced)
- BUT in simulator: sees route to /home, then /edit-profile, THEN screen renders
- Unexpected routing behavior before screen appears

This suggests:
1. GoRouter redirect logic firing in simulator but not tests
2. Initial location handling different in real app vs test
3. Authentication/TOS check causing redirect

Need to check:
- app_router.dart redirect logic (lines 81-112)
- TOS acceptance flow
- Authentication state on startup
