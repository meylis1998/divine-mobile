## Project Notes

**Zendesk Integration File Cleanup Issue**

The current implementation has a significant memory leak:
- Every bug report with logs creates a multi-MB temp file
- Files are never deleted after upload
- On iOS/Android this fills /tmp until OS cleanup (potentially days/weeks)
- User who submits 10 bug reports = 10 x 5MB = 50MB wasted in /tmp

Fix needed:
1. Add File cleanup in bug_report_dialog.dart after upload completes (success OR failure)
2. Use try/finally to ensure cleanup even on exceptions
3. Consider using isolate for export → upload → cleanup to prevent UI blocking
4. Add file size limit check before export (e.g. max 10MB, truncate if larger)

Also missing:
- File size validation before upload
- MIME type validation
- Platform support check before attempting upload
