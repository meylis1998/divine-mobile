## Project Notes

**ULTRATHINK Black Screen Bug - Nov 16**

## Critical Discovery from Nov 15 Journal

The Nov 15 journal entry documents this EXACT bug with root cause and solution:

**Root Cause**: Navigation timing race condition
- Flutter navigation animations take ~300ms
- If navigation happens before animation completes, modal barriers corrupt
- Results in invisible barrier blocking all UI touches
- User experiences "black screen" (actually frozen/unresponsive screen)

**Solution**: Add 300ms delay before navigation

## Current Implementation Status

Checked profile_setup_screen.dart:

**FIXED paths**:
- Line 995: Success save path - HAS delay (`Future.delayed(300ms)`)
- Line 1029: Error save path - HAS delay (`Future.delayed(300ms)`)

**UNFIXED path**:
- Line 145-168: Cancel/Back button - NO delay
- Uses `context.pop()` directly with try/catch fallback
- This is likely the source of continued black screen reports

## Next Steps
Need to check the Cancel/back button code (lines 145-168) to confirm it lacks the timing fix.
