## Project Notes

Implemented Lists tab for ExploreScreen in OpenVine:

**What was done:**
1. Added UserListService provider to app_providers.dart (CuratedListService already existed)
2. Created list_providers.dart with providers for:
   - userLists (kind 30000 people lists)
   - curatedLists (kind 30005 video lists)  
   - allLists (combined provider)
3. Created list_card.dart widgets for displaying both types of lists
4. Updated ExploreScreen._buildListsTab() to show actual lists instead of placeholder
5. Added pull-to-refresh and tab switch refresh logic

**Architecture:**
- UserListService: Manages NIP-51 kind 30000 people lists (includes "Divine Team" default)
- CuratedListService: Manages NIP-51 kind 30005 video playlists with full features
- Both services sync with Nostr relays
- Lists tab shows both types grouped by category

**UI Features:**
- Dark mode styling with VineTheme colors
- Separate sections for "People Lists" and "Video Lists"
- Card-based layout with icons, titles, descriptions, counts
- Pull-to-refresh support
- Empty state message when no lists exist
- TODO: Navigation to list detail screens (people grid / video feed)
