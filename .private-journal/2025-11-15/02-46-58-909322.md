## Project Notes

Found two list services in OpenVine:
1. UserListService (kind 30000 NIP-51) - manages lists of people/pubkeys, includes "Divine Team" default list
2. CuratedListService (kind 30005 NIP-51) - manages curated video lists with playlist features

Lists tab in ExploreScreen currently shows placeholder. Need to build UI to display both types:
- User lists (people collections)
- Curated lists (video collections)

Both services have full CRUD operations and Nostr sync capabilities.
