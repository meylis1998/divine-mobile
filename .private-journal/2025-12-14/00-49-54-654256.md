## Project Notes

Found camera state desync bug in OpenVine macOS build. Root cause: MacOSCameraInterface.reset() at line 1003 only resets Dart state but never calls NativeMacOSCamera.stopRecording() to sync Swift-side isRecording flag. The dispose() method does it correctly but reset() is missing it. Fix location: vine_recording_controller.dart around line 1003. The _cleanupMacOSRecording() function at line 2915 calls reset() but should also stop native recording first.
