## Project Notes

diVine Crashlytics integration patterns:
- Use CrashReportingService.instance.recordError(exception, stackTrace, reason: 'context')
- Always include relevant context in the reason parameter
- Report CRITICAL failures (0 relays connected, upload completely failed)
- Non-fatal errors are tracked separately from crashes
- Relay connection failures already well-instrumented
- Upload and publish failures now have full coverage
