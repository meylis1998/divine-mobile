## Project Notes

**OpenVine Beta Day 1 User Feedback** (2025-11-13)

Rabble provided feedback comparing OpenVine to original Vine:

**What's Working Well:**
- Press-and-hold recording ✅ (already implemented in `vine_recording_controls.dart`)
- Progress bar showing time remaining ✅ 
- Video transitions between segments are solid ✅

**Issue Identified:**
- **Audio chopping between segments** - Audio gets slightly cut/chopped when transitioning between recording segments
- This is likely happening during FFmpeg concatenation in `vine_recording_controller.dart` 
- Location: `_concatenateSegments()` method
- Impact: Minor UX degradation but noticeable to users familiar with Vine

**Technical Context:**
- App uses segment-based recording (press/release creates segments)
- FFmpeg concatenates segments into final video
- Video transitions work smoothly but audio continuity needs investigation
- Possible causes: audio codec settings, timestamp alignment, or FFmpeg concat demuxer options

**User Sentiment:** Very positive - "incredibly excited for what's to come" and "looking forward to reliving the 6 second memories again!"
