## Project Notes

**Video Feed Text Overlay UI Fix**

Changed approach for video text overlay background from full-width gradient to localized semi-transparent background:

**Before:**
- Large gradient overlay extending from bottom with `top: 40` padding
- Took up ~100px+ of screen space even for short text
- Started at `bottom: 0` (below the text)

**After:**  
- Removed full-width gradient completely
- Added `Colors.black.withValues(alpha: 0.6)` background directly to text Container
- Background only appears where text actually is
- Added `BorderRadius.circular(8)` for softer appearance
- Much cleaner and more efficient use of screen space

**File:** `mobile/lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart` lines ~720-812

This follows Rabble's suggestion to use opacity on the text background instead of a gradient, which is cleaner and more precise.
