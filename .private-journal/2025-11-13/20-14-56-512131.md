## Project Notes

**ProofMode UI Changes**

Per Rabble's request, moved ProofMode information from camera screen to Settings screen:

**Changes Made:**

1. **Camera Screen (universal_camera_screen_pure.dart):**
   - Removed ProofMode status indicator from AppBar (top right) - lines 462
   - Removed "ProofMode Active" badge from recording controls (bottom) - lines 815
   - Removed unused `_proofModeAvailable` field and `_checkProofModeAvailability()` method
   - ProofMode still functions normally, just no longer shown in camera UI

2. **Settings Screen (settings_screen.dart):**
   - Added "ProofMode Info" button in Support section
   - Button opens https://divine.video/proofmode in external browser
   - Uses url_launcher package (already in dependencies)
   - Added `_openProofModeInfo()` method with proper error handling

**Rationale:** ProofMode badges were taking up space on camera screen. Users can now learn about ProofMode in Settings, keeping camera UI cleaner.
