## Project Notes

**Android Crash Fixed Successfully**

**Problem**: App crashed on launch with "Not yet implemented" error in `onDetachedFromActivity`

**Root Cause**: `sensors_plus` v7.0.0 zombie dependency left in pubspec.yaml after ProofMode refactor deleted all production code that used it. Flutter registers ALL plugins on startup, even unused ones, and sensors_plus had a buggy `onDetachedFromActivity` implementation.

**Solution**: 
1. Removed `sensors_plus: ^7.0.0` from mobile/pubspec.yaml
2. Deleted obsolete test files (proofmode_sensor_collector_test.dart, proofmode_session_service_test.dart)
3. Ran `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
4. Rebuilt and tested on Android

**Verification**: App now launches successfully on Android with no crash. All services initialize properly.

**Key Lesson**: When refactoring to remove features, ALWAYS audit and remove associated dependencies from pubspec.yaml to prevent zombie plugin lifecycle issues.
