## Project Notes

Video Reply Feature Design:
- User wants video replies to comments in OpenVine
- Using Approach 2: Separate models (Comment for Kind 1, VideoEvent for Kind 34236) with unified threading
- Both will use same e/p tag structure for threading
- Need to create a sealed class or base type for CommentNode to hold either type
- Will reuse existing VideoEvent model and VideoFeedItem widget for display
- Recording flow: tap video icon next to Reply button → open camera with reply context → publish Kind 34236 with reply tags
- Key insight: fetchCommentsForEvent needs to query both kinds [1, 34236] with e tag filter
