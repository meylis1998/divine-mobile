## Project Notes

Fixed double overlay issue in video feed:

**Problem**: User reported two semi-transparent boxes at bottom of video:
- A larger darker overlay (blurhash background)
- A smaller overlay behind the text
- Both were stacking, creating a double-layered effect

**Solution** in `mobile/lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart`:
1. **Removed blurhash background** (lines 574-593) - This was the "bigger box" causing the layered effect
   - Was showing at height: 200px with opacity 0.3
   - Created unnecessary visual noise
2. **Reduced text background opacity** from 0.6 to 0.4 (line 714)
   - Makes the remaining overlay more subtle and transparent
   - Text is still readable with text shadows

**Result**: Clean single overlay that only appears when there's text content, much more transparent and less visually intrusive.

**Key Learning**: When adding overlays for text readability, avoid stacking multiple semi-transparent layers. A single well-designed overlay with proper text shadows is cleaner and more professional. The blurhash background was creating visual clutter without adding value.
