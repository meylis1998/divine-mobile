## Project Notes

**Android Crash Root Cause Found: Zombie Dependency**

**Problem**: App crashing on Android launch with "Not yet implemented" error in `onDetachedFromActivity` during activity destruction.

**Root Cause**: 
- `sensors_plus` v7.0.0 is a zombie dependency left in pubspec.yaml after ProofMode refactor
- Git history shows commit 97a9303 deleted Dart ProofMode services (including ProofModeSensorCollector)
- Commit 59b45d4 cleaned up remaining references
- BUT sensors_plus was never removed from pubspec.yaml
- Flutter registers ALL plugins on startup, even unused ones
- sensors_plus v7.0.0 has buggy/incomplete `onDetachedFromActivity` implementation
- When Android destroys activity, plugin throws NotImplementedError

**Evidence**:
1. sensors_plus only appears in test files, NOT in production code (mobile/lib/)
2. ProofModeSensorCollector.dart no longer exists
3. Git history confirms intentional deletion of Dart sensor code
4. Error stack trace shows `onDetachedFromActivity` → `onDestroy` crash path

**Solution**: Remove sensors_plus from dependencies in mobile/pubspec.yaml

**Lesson Learned**: When refactoring to remove feature implementations, ALWAYS audit and remove associated dependencies to prevent zombie plugin issues.
