## Project Notes

**Testing confirmed fix works**:
- App successfully initialized on Android emulator after fix
- Auth state transitioned correctly from `checking` → `authenticated`
- User session established without hanging
- All subsequent services initialized properly
- No loading screen deadlock observed

The logs show clean initialization sequence:
```
[19:56:15.792] [AUTH] Initializing SecureAuthService
[19:56:15.869] [AUTH] Auth state changed: authenticated  
[19:56:15.869] [AUTH] Secure user session established
[19:56:15.870] [SYSTEM] [INIT] ✅ AuthService initialized
```

This confirms the synchronous state changes work correctly and don't block the UI.
