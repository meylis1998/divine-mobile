## Project Notes

**Tap-Anywhere Recording Implementation** (2025-11-13)

Successfully implemented Vine-style tap-anywhere-to-record UX for OpenVine:

**Changes Made:**
- Wrapped camera preview in `GestureDetector` in `universal_camera_screen_pure.dart:530-622`
- Detects `onTapDown` to start recording, `onTapUp`/`onTapCancel` to stop
- Only active on mobile platforms (!kIsWeb), web still uses button-only tap-to-toggle
- Uses `HitTestBehavior.translucent` to allow gestures to pass through to camera controls
- Updated instruction text to "Tap and hold anywhere to record" (line 838)

**Technical Details:**
- Reuses existing `_startRecording()` and `_stopRecording()` methods - no duplication
- Respects `recordingState.canRecord` and `recordingState.isRecording` states
- Works alongside existing record button - both methods work simultaneously
- Doesn't interfere with camera controls overlay (flash button, zoom, focus)

**Testing Status:**
- Code compiles cleanly (flutter analyze shows no new errors)
- Needs real device testing to verify UX feels right
- Should test that camera controls (flash, zoom) still work properly

**User Benefit:**
- Much easier one-handed recording (original Vine behavior)
- Can hold phone naturally and tap anywhere on screen
- More intuitive UX - no need to precisely hit the button
