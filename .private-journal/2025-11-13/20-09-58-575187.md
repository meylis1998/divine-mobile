## Project Notes

Fixed iOS build issue by removing unused wifi_iot plugin:
- Plugin was declared in pubspec.yaml for "WiFi Direct for Android high-bandwidth sharing"
- Not used anywhere in the codebase (no imports in lib/)
- Caused Swift bridging header error on iOS: 'wifi_iot-Swift.h' file not found
- Solution: Commented out the dependency in pubspec.yaml with explanation
- Ran flutter pub get to update dependencies
