## Project Notes

Fixed video overlay gradient issue in OpenVine:

**Problem**: Semi-transparent gradient overlay at bottom of video screen was:
- Always visible even when there was no text content to protect
- Taking up 100px of screen space (too much)
- Showing 90% opacity black gradient even on videos without titles

**Solution** in `mobile/lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart`:
1. Added `hasTextContent` check: `video.content.isNotEmpty || (video.title != null && video.title!.isNotEmpty)`
2. Made gradient conditional - only shows when `hasTextContent` is true
3. Reduced gradient height from 100px to 40px (top padding)
4. Reduced opacity from 0.9 to 0.85 at bottom
5. Also made blurhash background conditional (height 250→200px, opacity 0.4→0.3)
6. Made title text section conditional - doesn't show "Untitled" anymore

**Result**: Videos without text content now show cleanly without overlay covering the video. Videos with text still have readable overlays but they're smaller and less intrusive.

**Key learning**: UI overlays should be conditional based on content presence, not just always visible. Fixed height overlays waste screen space.
